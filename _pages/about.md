Hi, my name is Floor! I am a Zurich-based Research Scientist working at Huawei, where I do research in the field of generative AI. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the [Interactive Geometry Lab](https://igl.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich, where I was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Olga Sorkine-Hornung](https://igl.ethz.ch/people/sorkine/index.php).

My research focuses on the intersections of AI/ML, computer graphics, and computer vision. I am passionate about 3D geometry and more generally love doing research that aims to simplify or enhance creative design processes for both creative beginners as well as professionals. With expertise both in AI/ML and classical geometry processing, I tackle research challenges from diverse angles to come up with creative solutions.

In my spare time, I love to go fishing to unwind. What began as a hobby has led me to become the 2021 Women’s World Champion, and led and my team to a silver medal at the 2024 and 2016 World Championships.
