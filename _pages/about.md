Hi, my name is Floor! I earned my PhD from the [Interactive Geometry Lab](https://igl.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich, where I was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Olga Sorkine-Hornung](https://igl.ethz.ch/people/sorkine/index.php).

My research focuses on the intersections of computer graphics, artificial intelligence and computer vision. I am passionate about 2D and 3D geometry and more generally love developing innovative systems that simplify or enhance creative design processes. With expertise both in classical geometry processing and machine learning, I tackle research challenges from diverse angles to create robust solutions.

In my spare time, I love to go fishing to unwind. What began as a hobby has led me to become the 2021 Women’s World Champion, and my team and I have been the Dutch National Champion for the past 5 years.

I am currently seeking a position as a research scientist or engineer where I can apply my skills to challenging problems in 2D and 3D geometry or creative software development.
